- [x] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
      Class component have the react lifecycles Methods. You may want to use those method on a project.
- [x] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
      Mounting-These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM: constructor(); render(); and componentDidMount.
      Updating-An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called in the following order when a component is being re-rendered: render() and componentDidUpdate.
      Unmounting- This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM: componentwillUnmount.
- [x] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
      Building your own Hooks lets you extract component logic into reusable functions.
- [x] Why is it important to test our apps?

  Reduces the risk of regressions.
  Allows us to trust the code.
  Makes us think about the edge cases.
  Acts as a safety net when making changes or refactoring.
  Acts as documentation for the code.
  Encourages us to write more testable (better!) code.
